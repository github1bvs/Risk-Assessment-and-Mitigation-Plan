## Objectives
 
- Identify potential risks affecting the organization.
- Assess the impact and likelihood of identified risks.
- Develop and implement mitigation strategies.
- Monitor and review risks and mitigation measures regularly.
 
## Deliverables
 
- **Risk Assessment Report**: Document detailing identified risks, their impact, and likelihood.
- **Risk Register**: A centralized repository of all identified risks, including their status and mitigation plans.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Detailed plans and actions to address and reduce the impact of identified risks.
- **Risk Management Plan**: Comprehensive plan outlining the process for managing and monitoring risks.
